The role of uncertainty quantification (UQ) has become indispensable with the advent of artificial intelligence and its application to the decision-making. This thesis leverages conformal prediction (CP) as its cornerstone, a pivotal methodology in the field of distribution-free and model-agnostic UQ, which stems from the notion of "\textit{conformalizing}" predictions to data using the residuals to understand the errors distribution. 

In particular, in this work some strategies within the CP approach are theoretically justified, and its guarantees and limitations presented. Even though the CP paradigm was classically applied only under "\textit{data exchangeability}" conditions, this work also reviews some of the most recent and non-trivial efforts to enable CP when this hypothesis is not fulfilled. 

Lastly, to practically demonstrate CP ability to provide prediction intervals with statistically valid coverage, different strategies are successfully applied both to a tabular data regression problem and to a time series forecasting problem.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis supervisor, Jordi Vitrià, for his invaluable guidance and mentorship throughout the development of this thesis. His early direction and thoughtful corrections have been instrumental in shaping this work, providing me with continuous insights that deeply enhanced my understanding and execution of the project.

Special thanks are extended to my family, and in particular to my mother, Mercè. Their unwavering support, patience, and boundless love have been the cornerstone of my strength and perseverance throughout this academic journey. Their belief in my capabilities has been a constant source of encouragement.

I am also immensely grateful to my friends, who have supported me unconditionally. Their encouragement, through both kind words and endless supplies of cheap coffees, along with their patience in listening to my frequent explanations, have made this journey not only bearable but also enjoyable.

This thesis would not have been possible without the contributions and support of each one of you. Thank you.
