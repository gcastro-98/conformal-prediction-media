# Conformal prediction and beyond

Thesis and presentation on conformal prediction carried out as part of (UB 2023) MSc thesis work.
Throughout this work, uncertainty quantification for distribution-free and data-agnostic problems is applied in terms of conformal prediction (CP) methodologies. In particular, this is applied to regression problems involving both exchangeable and time-series data.
